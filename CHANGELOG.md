## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Declarative timestamps, via markawesome-js's new `date` transformer. The inline `[[[ <date> <tokens> ]]]` form renders an absolute, locale-formatted date (`<wa-format-date>`); a leading `relative` token renders a "3 days ago"-style phrase (`<wa-relative-time>`). A block alternative (`:::wa-format-date` / `:::wa-relative-time` … `:::`) is also accepted. The date value is baked into the Markdown at build time; the browser formats it via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` / `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` with no JavaScript wiring or data fetching.
  - `style:`/`time:` presets (`short|medium|long|full`), granular overrides (`weekday`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, … plus `hour-format`, `time-zone-name`, `time-zone`), and `lang:`/`locale:` are supported; a bare date defaults to `style:long`. Relative timestamps take `format:`, `numeric:`, and a `sync` flag for live ticking. Omitting the date renders the viewer's current time.
- Example site's new `## Dates / Timestamps` section exercises the presets, a datetime with `time:` + `hour-format:24`, French/German locales, a granular override, relative times (incl. `format:short` and live `sync`), both block forms, and a no-date "current time" stamp. Validated live in the browser against the examples kit (WA 3.9.0): the components upgrade and render real formatted text in their shadow DOM — e.g. `style:full` → "Friday, June 26, 2026", `lang:fr` → "vendredi 26 juin 2026", `lang:de` → "Freitag, 26. Juni 2026", `hour-format:24` → "Jun 26, 2026, 17:30", relative → "last week" / "4 wk. ago" / live "1 hour ago", and a no-date `time:medium` → the current "12:48:14 PM".
  - Like `<wa-icon>`, both components render generated text into shadow DOM with no light-DOM fallback — with Web Awesome's JS disabled they show nothing.
- Aligned placements + `skidding` for popovers and tooltips, and a per-tab `disabled` flag, via markawesome-js's expanded `popover`/`tooltip`/`tabs` transformers. `<wa-popover>`/`<wa-tooltip>` now accept all twelve Web Awesome placements (the four primary plus the eight aligned variants `top-start`, `bottom-end`, …) and a `skidding:N` token that offsets the floating element *along* its target (negative values allowed), complementing the existing `distance:N` (offset *away*). A leading `disabled` token on a `+++ ` tab item header (e.g. `+++ disabled Coming soon`) renders the tab but prevents selection, mirroring the accordion item flags.
- Example site adds cases for each: an "Aligned Placement and Skidding" subsection in both `## Popovers` and `## Tooltips`, and a "Disabled Tab" subsection in `## Tab Groups`. Validated live in the browser against the examples kit (WA 3.9.0): the components upgrade and the attributes reflect and take effect in the live DOM — `placement="bottom-end"` anchors the popover to its trigger's end edge; toggling `skidding` from 0 to 12 shifts the rendered popup exactly 12px along the trigger axis; the tooltip parses a negative `skidding="-4"`; and `<wa-tab disabled>` renders `aria-disabled="true"` with `tabindex="-1"` and stays non-activatable on click (a normal tab still activates, the disabled one is ignored).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-26

Initial release.

### Added

- An Eleventy 3.x plugin that registers a `markawesome` preprocessor delegating
  to the [`markawesome-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markawesome-js) engine.
- Options: `extensions`, `debug`, `imageDialog`, `calloutIcons`,
  `shouldTransform`.
- `imageDialog` normalization (`true` | `{ defaultWidth }`) forwarded to the
  engine; `calloutIcons` pushed globally via `configure()` at registration.
- Opt-out via `shouldTransform` returning `false` (the preprocessor returns
  `undefined`, never `false`, so files are never accidentally excluded).
- Example Eleventy site mirroring the `jekyll-webawesome` examples (same Web
  Awesome CDN kit, component-spacing CSS, and a full component showcase).
- Integration tests that run Eleventy programmatically over fixture pages and
  assert the rendered `<wa-*>` output, code-block survival, opt-out, and
  `imageDialog` behaviour.

### Requirements

- `@11ty/eleventy` `>=3.0.0` (peer dependency; preprocessors are an Eleventy 3.0
  feature).
- `markawesome-js` `^0.1.0` (regular dependency).
